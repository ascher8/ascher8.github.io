  <h1>Hey there!</h1>
  <p>I'm Aaron, I'm a researcher working on AI safety and some of my main focuses are sycophancy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and interpretability in large language models. 
    I'm broadly interested in empirical research with current AI systems that can inform the safe design and deployment of future, more powerful AIs.
